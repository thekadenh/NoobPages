# Section 1.1 - Introduction
## The method

Typical compilers have 3 different optimization levels. Optimization, in
this case, can be targeted towards **code size** or **code speed**.

Compilers that have no optimizations compile code faster, but at a runtime
or memory cost. If you spend some quality time compiling the code, however,
then it could run faster with optimizations. You can also specify
whether or not the compiler includes potentially useful debug information.

**Assembly Language is just a human interpretation of Machine Code.**
