HackTheBox on SQL injection:

*We often find SQL injection vulnerabilities on web applications that use Active Directory for authentication. While we can usually not leverage this to extract passwords (since Active Directory administers them), we can often pull most or all Active Directory user email addresses, which are often the same as their usernames. This data can then be used to perform a password spraying attack against web portals that use Active Directory for authentication such as VPN or Microsoft Outlook Web Access/Microsoft O365. A successful password spray can often result in access to sensitive data such as email or even a foothold directly into the corporate network environment.*

**Active Directory** is a windows directory service
for Windows domain networks.
